Plan for today

1- Integrate devices with the server using jython.
	- issue: jython can't load python modules (gertboard and piface) 			that depends on c
2- integrate interface for Motor and sensor with server (step 1)

3 â€“ Start presentation for code review

4- Work on request/response xml messages

What we did?

Implemented Interface for motor and sensor in interface
Developed a simple prototype (without xml or device integration) to demonstrate server/client model
Experiment with integration of python (jython).
Design the flow of the system (sequence diagram)
